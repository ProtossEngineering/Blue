#Store Prototype##Open Questions+ What is the best way for Unity developers to fake up license information for debugging? - Should it be embedded in the plugin? And you can choose from a few enums? - You can pass in some info that gets serialized to a license file that gets loaded by the simulator+ How do you return data from an async function in a plugin (since we’re wrapping async functions with CoreWindow.Dispatcher.RunAsync)+ What is the roadmap for Unity w.r.t. Universal apps and Phone 8.1? How does that affect our efforts?## Plugin Environment Protips1. It’s good to have your plugin vs project build right into the unity plugin folder so you don’t have to drag and drop with every reload2. MonoDevelop put’s a lock on the plugin files while it’s open. You need to close it everytime you rebuild the plugin3. Unity isn’t very good at cleaning up an exported game. Before using Build &Run with pre-defined settings, delete the previously exported game
