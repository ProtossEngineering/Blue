## So what is WinBridge, exactly?

The Unity Windows Controls Library is a plugin for Unity3D that enables easier command of native controls and features of WinRT (the underlying library behind Windows Store, Windows Phone and Xbox One apps).

This repository is open-source and currently maintained by a small group of Microsoft developer evangelists. It should be noted that this plugin is provided as-is with no warranties given. It is released under the MS-LPL license (more information below).
